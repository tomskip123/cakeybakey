Dear adudicators of my cakeybakey project.

I figured this would be a little simple, so I decided to bump it up a little.

I've decided to include frameworks that include testing out of the box to make things a little more simple, 

the frameworks are nestjs and nextjs

nextjs is using material-ui

oh and for the lols I wacked it in a docker container and included a build script just for lols.
